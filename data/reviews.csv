4/6/2022 14:32,Towers,5,Pleasant Experience at Towers,"Towers was a nice dorm, and being attached to the GT connector was very nice. Shared bathrooms and kitchen were kept fairly clean. The hallways would sometimes get loud in the middle of the night. Main downside was that a bunch of the students in Towers were in Greek life and thus didn't stay in the dorms much, which hurt the sense of community a bit.","Safe, Lounges, Gym, Lively",,1 semester - 1 year,Good 👍,Good 👍,Good 👍,Good 👍,Good 👍,,buzzbuzz1,

4/15/2022 17:36,Nelson Shell,4,Nelson Shell Experience,I lived in Nelson. I felt this was the best housing I have had at Georgia Tech.

4/15/2022 17:46,Harris,3,Harris Story,"Harris was a reasonable place to live. At its price point and space provided it is reasonable. I would advise students on the ground floor to not get a room near to the entrance. The opening and closing of doors can get loud. The only downside of this setup is that you have to share one bathroom and one shower among 4 people, but its location is good. It is near the library and Tech square.

4/15/2022 17:55,Towers,4,Towers Experience,"I felt Towers was a pretty good place to live. There is a common bathroom and shower setup. I prefer this setup as housing cleans it daily. The common kitchen was a mess when I lived there. Laundry is included on the floor which is not common in GT dorms. Housing can be slow to respond if there is an issue with your room. Room space is about average. Overall, I would say this is one of the better dorms at GT. Good proximity to the GT connector which has exercise equipment.

4/15/2022 18:03,Harrison,2,Harrison Bad,"One time I walked into the shared bathrooms and all of the toilets were either clogged or covered with a black trash bag (out of order). Also had issues with cleanliness of the showers: people would leave hair clogging the drains, and even had an incident when someone left feces in one of the showers. The shared bedrooms are extremely small, so there is very little privacy between roommates. There also is no elevator in the building, so moving in and out was a hassle because we had to carry all of our stuff up and down flights of stairs.","Safe, Convenient location for freshmen","Smell, Unhygienic, lack of utilities (shared bathrooms, no on-site laundry, small shared kitchen)",1 semester - 1 year,Good 👍,N/A,Bad 👎,N/A,Bad 👎,,anonymousnoodle,

4/15/2022 18:36,Harris,3,It's an average college dorm. Nothing in particular that is noteworthy. I was on the first floor so I avoided stairs at least. The kitchen area was nostalgic for me however since I spent a lot of time studying in there while my roommate was sleeping late at night. ,I did enjoy the lounge / couch area elsewhere on the first floor. I'd play chess with some people at the tables over there or also do some studying.

Additionally, while some people complain about how you have to walk up a hill to get to a decent chunk of classes if you're on East, walking down it on the way back is p' fun (and kudos if you get a bike then you can zoom).

4/23/2022 21:12,Caldwell,4,your dorm preference depends on different factors,"Your dorm preference depends on a lot of different factors. Here’s a few things that I’ve noticed are generally true: Quieter = West, Livelier = East, Frats/Sororities = East, Closer access to NCAA sports events = East, Closer access to the CRC (Campus Recreation Center) = West, School of Music = West, More green space = West, Closer to Midtown/Tech Square/College of Business = East, Slightly bigger dorms = West. These are just a few things that I’ve noticed. Another thing I’d say is, although the best dorms on campus are on East (Glenn/Towers), there really aren’t any “bad” dorms on West (which is in contrast to some dorms on East that haven’t been renovated since the 90s). Even Caldwell, which is where I currently live on West, has had some minor renovations such as new flooring in recent years despite the fact that it hasn’t had a “major” renovation since the early 2000s. Your classes will likely all be towards the middle of campus between East and West so I’d say just consider some of these factors (and others that I’m sure I’m missing) when deciding where to live.",,,,,,,,,,reddit19,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/s6n3pw/best_dorm_for_first_year_student/

I'm kind of a lazy person so it was hard for me to get up and go to class. Being farther away from the library was also quite annoying. I would also say the dining halls (brittain and nave) are better. However, if you like to work out and don't like noise (sirens), west might be better bc it's closer to the crc and quieter.
